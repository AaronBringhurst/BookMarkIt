# BookMarkIt

## Description

BookMarkIt is a full-stack MERN application that allows avid readers to search for new books to read and keep a list of books to purchase. It leverages the Google Books API for book searches and enables users to save books to their account. The application is built using React for the front end, MongoDB for the database, and Node.js/Express.js for the server, with GraphQL and Apollo Server for efficient data fetching and manipulation.
